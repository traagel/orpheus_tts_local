There once was a Moon Man, quite pale and quite proud,
He danced on the stairs while singing aloud.
But alas! One misstep, one slip of the shoe,
And down he did tumble, with much hullabaloo!

He flipped and he flopped like a flapjack gone mad,
Each bounce on the steps made a sound most unclad.
Till BAM! he did crash, oh tragic misnomerâ€”
Right into the altar of Macaco the Gloater.
